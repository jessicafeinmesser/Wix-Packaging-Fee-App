//plugin.ts implements the Wix Ecom Additional Fees service plugin. 
//It uses helper function  getPackagingFee to fetch the fee from the backend API and returns it in the appropriate Additional Fees format.
//It appears that it is missing authentication steps in order for the fetch to work, even though fetchWithAuth in the Wix CLI is supposed to do the authentication.
//I tried both using the Wix Client method and creating a new API to fetch the InstanceID and use it here for further authentication, but neither of those options worked,
//and the deadline to submit was approaching so I decided to leave as is. The packaging fee currently always defaults to 10.
